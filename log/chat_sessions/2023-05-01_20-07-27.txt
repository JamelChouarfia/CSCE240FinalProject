Bot: Scabies is a skin condition in people caused by the human itch mite. The mite burrows into the upper layer of skin to live and lay eggs.

Common scabies symptoms include intense itching and a skin rash. Scabies can occur anywhere on the body but are more common on the following parts of the body:
   - Between the fingers
   - Wrist
   - Elbow
   - Armpit
   - Genitals (Penis and Vagina)
   - Nipple
   - Waist
   - Buttocks
   - Shoulder blades
For people who have never had scabies before, symptoms usually take 4-6 weeks to appear. Symptoms appear more quickly in people who have had scabies before, in as few as 1 to 4 days. Scabies mites can spread to other parts of the body and from one person to another person even before symptoms start.
The same mite that causes scabies also causes crusted scabies. Crusted scabies is severe scabies that happens in people who have weakened immune systems. People with crusted scabies are infested with very large numbers of mites. This increases their risk of spreading mites to others, either from brief skin-to-skin contact or from contact with items such as bedding, clothing, furniture, rugs, and carpeting.
